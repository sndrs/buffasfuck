Transept release Buff as Fuck, their second full-length album, on 25 March, 2013 through their own Dronehenge label.

Mixed with Luke Abbott and mastered by Rashad Becker, Buff as Fuck opens with an old Yamaha keyboard playing through a rattling crystal inside a stone bowl on the 15-minute pseudo-raga of Happysburgh¹.

Next is a hollow, spiky re-rendering of make-believe elegy Sea Sentinel (from Transept's first album), the woozy scrapes of Let's Go and Supermoon Party Bucket and the handmade, stammering drone-march of Muscle Beach. The album closes with a euphonious laptop chamber orchestra on an uncanny, rippling version of Bright Eyes².

Recorded in Norfolk at their studio in a former handbag factory, Buff as Fuck is released with hand screen-printed covers on clear frosted vinyl as well as CD and download.

¹ Named after the mispronunciation of the eroding Norfolk village of Happisburgh.

² Taken from a full-length live soundtrack performance/manipulation of Watership Down.
